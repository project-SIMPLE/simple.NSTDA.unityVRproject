Version 2.9
    Converted .js scripts to .cs scripts because javascript is depricated

Version 2.8
	Removed references to textureBakeResults.materials because it was depricated
	Updated renderer castShadow API

Version 2.7 Feb. 16, 2016
	Fixed "don't bake into combined" so that it works with billboard renderers

Version 2.6
  Fix to work with Mesh Baker 3.7.3 and clean compile on Unity 5

Version 2.5
	Fixed warnings when compiling
	Fixed boolean compare bug

Version 2.4
    Added the ability to move all clusters so that the world can be recentered around the origin 
    to avoid floating point precision glitches.

Version 2.3
    Added a new Cluster type Moving
    Updated the city scene to be more efficient.
    
Version 2.2
	Updated to use Mesh Baker 3 components. Requires MeshBaker version 3 or higher. Read the README
	for information on upgrading.

Version 2.1
	Added Cast Receive Shadows option
	Refactored queue to store the latest transaction.
	Added split and merge to try to reduce the maximum number of meshes in an atomic bake.

Version 2.0
	A big refactor and a number of performance improvements
		Refactored Initialization of LODs it happens in Start instead of on first LOD change
		Removed changed "Update" to "CheckIfLODNeedsToChange" in MB2_LOD
		Created a class for checking if LODs need to change. Close-to-camera clusters are checked frequently,
			distant clusters are checked less frequently
		Added the check scheduler to the LOD Manager
		Refactored the Cluster class by splitting into two classes
			LODCombinedMesh is a wrapper for MB2_CombinedMesh that contains Queues and
				performs callbacks on baking.
			Cluster is a defined volume and contains one or more LODCombinedMeshes
		By splitting the cluster it is possible to bake only part of a combined mesh
		Added a "SwapMeshWithLOD0" checkbox to the levels in the LOD. This makes
			managing animations MUCH easier.
		

Version 1.4
	A number of performance improvements
		Added an offset to the LOD frame check so that each cluster's lods check in a different frame
		Garbage collection time is included in measure of how long a frame is taking
		Better diagnostic information 	

Version 1.2
	Fixed serious bug with LOD Manager singleton switching scenes
	Each LOD level hierarchy is deactivated instead of just the mesh game object

Version 1.1
	Fixed bug which would cause SkinnedMeshLODs with max per level set to bake every frame
	Can add and remove bakers at runtime
	Can use orthographic cameras

Version 1.0.2

	Added force to level for LOD
	Added max number of LODs at a certain level
	Fixed bug where LOD object is sometimes not deleted
	Fixed bug activating and deactivating child objects.
	Added logging individual objects
	Added updateSkinnedMeshRender bounds
	Fixes warnings in Unity 4
