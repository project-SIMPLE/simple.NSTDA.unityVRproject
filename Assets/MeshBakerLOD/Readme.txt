IMPORTANT UPGRADE INFORMATION

This version of Mesh Baker LOD is not compatible with earlier versions since it requires MB3 components instead of
MB2 components. Switching is fairly easy:

	1) Select each MeshBaker game object and click "Migrate to version 3"
	2) Drag that MeshBaker game object to the appropriate slot in the LODManager


Tested with Mesh Baker  version 3+
